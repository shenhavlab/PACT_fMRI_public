Pattern component modelling toolbox
===================================

JÃ¶rn Diedrichsen, Spencer Arbuckle, and Atusushi Yokoi

# Overview 
The pattern-component modelling (PCM) toolbox provides function for model fitting, comparison, and some basic visualization. Users can use these provided functions to test various hypotheses about how the brain represents features of external world or actions. This readme page just briefly summarizes the contents of the toolbox and short comments. The complete-version of this manual accompanying with some example use of the codes and full-details of mathematical derivations is provided [here](https://github.com/jdiedrichsen/pcm_toolbox/blob/master/pcm_toolbox_manual.pdf). Also, some scientific background, discussions, and relationship between other relevant approaches can be found [here](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/25/120584) and [there](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/02/071472). 

What the toolbox does *not* provide are functions to extract the required data from the first-level GLM or raw data, search-light code or code for ROI definition. We have omitted these function as they strongly depend on the analysis package used for basic imaging analysis. Some useful tools for the extraction of multivariate data from the standard first-level GLM, please see the [RSA-toolbox](https://github.com/rsagroup/rsatoolbox) and [Surfing toolbox](https://github.com/nno/surfing). 

The functions provided in the toolbox can be categorized into different categories:  

### Basic likelihood and optimization

These are the functions that perform the core statistical functions of the toolbox.
