function [sidxs,r2]=surfing_selectkfirstidxs(k,idxs,inclmsk)
% selects approximately the first k non-zero unique indices
%
% SIDXS=SURFING_SELECTKFIRSTIDXS(K,IDXS,[ROWHINT])
%
% INPUT:
%  K:       number of indices to select
%  IDXS:    NxP matrix with indices, corresponding to N nodes with at most P
%           indices each.
% OUTPUT:
%  SIDXS:   K2x1 matrix with unique indices, taken from IDXS. SIDXS contains
%           the indices from IDXS, starting with the first row, the second
%           row, etc, until K2 (approximately K) indices are found that
%           are all unique and non-zero. Either all values from a row are
%           selected or none. The function tries to find the best number of
%           rows in an unbiased way.
% ROWCOUNT: number of rows selected from IDXS.
